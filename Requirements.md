# ðŸš€ Project Requirements: Team Randomizer Web App

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based application designed to randomize a list of names into equal-sized teams, with options for importing and exporting data.

---

### 1. User Interface (UI) Requirements

These requirements focus on how the user interacts with the application.

* **1.1. Name Input Area**
    * **Requirement:** The application shall provide a clear and intuitive area for users to input names.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Design and implement a **text area** or a series of input fields for entering names.
        * Allow names to be entered **one per line** or separated by a delimiter (e.g., commas).
        * Provide a **clear label** (e.g., "Enter Names Here").
        * Include a **"Clear All" button** to easily empty the input area.

* **1.2. Team Configuration**
    * **Requirement:** Users must be able to specify the desired number of teams.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Implement an **input field or dropdown** for selecting the "Number of Teams" (minimum 2).
        * Add **validation** to ensure the number of teams is a positive integer and does not exceed the number of entered names.

* **1.3. Action Buttons**
    * **Requirement:** Clearly visible buttons for core actions.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Design and implement a prominent **"Randomize Teams" button**.
        * Design and implement an **"Export Teams to CSV" button**.
        * Design and implement an **"Import Names from File" button**.

* **1.4. Team Display Area**
    * **Requirement:** The randomized teams must be displayed clearly.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Create a dedicated section to display the **generated teams and their members**.
        * Each team should have a **clear heading** (e.g., "Team 1", "Team Alpha").
        * Display team members in an easily readable format (e.g., bullet points or a list).

* **1.5. Responsive Design**
    * **Requirement:** The application must be usable and visually appealing on various screen sizes.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Implement a **responsive layout** using CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS) to adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
        * Ensure all interactive elements are **touch-friendly** on mobile devices.

### 2. Functionality Requirements

These requirements detail what the application must do.

* **2.1. Name Processing**
    * **Requirement:** The application must correctly parse and prepare names for randomization.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Process names from the input area, handling **empty lines or extra spaces**.
        * Remove **duplicate names** (optional, but good for usability â€“ consider a toggle).

* **2.2. Team Randomization Logic**
    * **Requirement:** Names must be randomized into approximately equal-sized teams.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Implement an algorithm to **randomly assign each name** to a team.
        * Ensure teams are as **equal in size** as possible. If the total number of names is not perfectly divisible by the number of teams, distribute the remainder as evenly as possible among teams (e.g., some teams get one extra member).
        * Handle edge cases, such as **fewer names than desired teams** (e.g., display an error message).

* **2.3. Import Names Functionality**
    * **Requirement:** Users must be able to import names from a local file.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Implement a **file input element** that accepts `.txt` or `.csv` files.
        * Upon file selection, **read the contents** of the file.
        * Parse names from the file, assuming **one name per line** for `.txt` or a **single column** for `.csv`.
        * Populate the **name input area** with the imported names.

* **2.4. Export Teams Functionality**
    * **Requirement:** Users must be able to export the randomized teams to a CSV file.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Format the generated teams into a **CSV string**. The CSV should have columns like "Team Name", "Member Name".
        * Initiate a **file download** of the generated CSV file (e.g., `teams.csv`).

### 3. Technical Requirements

These requirements cover the underlying technology and development considerations.

* **3.1. Web Technologies**
    * **Requirement:** The application shall be built using standard web technologies.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Use **HTML** for structure.
        * Use **CSS** (preferably Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling) for styling.
        * Use **JavaScript** for all application logic and interactivity.

* **3.2. Browser Compatibility**
    * **Requirement:** The application should function correctly across modern web browsers.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

* **3.3. Error Handling and User Feedback**
    * **Requirement:** The application should provide clear feedback for user actions and errors.
    * **Tasks:**
        * Implement **error messages** for invalid inputs (e.g., "Please enter at least two names," "Number of teams must be a positive integer").
        * Provide **success messages** (e.g., "Teams successfully randomized!").
        * Use **loading indicators** if any operations might take noticeable time (e.g., very large file imports, though unlikely for this app).
